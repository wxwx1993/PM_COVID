<img src="https://img.shields.io/badge/Study%20Status-Publication%20Available-green.svg" alt="Study Status: Publication Available"> 

This is the data repository for public available code and data to reproduce analyses in Wu, X., Nethery, R.C., Sabath, M.B., Braun, D. and Dominici, F., 2020. Air pollution and COVID-19 mortality in the United States: strengths and limitations of an ecological regression analysis. Science advances, 6(45), p.eabd4049.

<b>Summary Results: </b><br>
![](./Data/RR_time.png)
Figure: COVID-19 mortality rate ratios (MRR) per 1 μg/m3 increase in PM2.5 and 95% CI using daily cumulative COVID-19 death counts from April 18, 2020 to June 18, 2020.

<b>Code: </b><br>
[`Prepossing.R`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/PM_COVID/blob/master/Preprocessing.R) includes the code to extract all necessary data and prepocess data for statistical analyses.

[`Analyses.R`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/PM_COVID/blob/master/Analyses.R) includes the code to implement negative binomial mixed models in primary, secondary and sensitivity analyses.

[`Figure.R`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/PM_COVID/blob/master/Figure.R) includes the code to generate figures in Main Text and Supplementary Materials.

[`additional_preprocessing_code`](https://github.com/wxwx1993/PM_COVID/tree/master/additional_preprocessing_code) contains markdown files with code demonstrating the methodology we used to aggregate our zip code level data to the county level.


<b>Data: </b><br>
county_pm25.csv (UPDATED ON THIS BRANCH): This has been updated to be aggregated directly from the source raster data to the county level, and to include data that now runs from 2000-2018. Originally, the county-level PM2.5 exposure data averaged across the period 2000-2016 and averaged across grid cells in each county. For more source information see Additional Data Source section.

temp_seasonal_county.csv: the county-level seasonal temperature and relative humidity data, summer and winter averaged across the period 2000-2016 and averaged across grid cells in each county. For more source information see Additional Data Source section.

census_county_interpolated.csv (UPDATED ON THIS BRANCH): This is a number of census variables covering the period from 2000-2018 downloaded from the decennial census and the ACS. See the census pipline in `additional_preprocessing_code` for more information. Originally this was the county-level socioeconomic and demographic variables from 2012-2016 American Community Survey (https://www.census.gov/programs-surveys/acs/data.html).

county_base_mortality.txt, county_old_mortality.txt: additional county-level socioeconomic and demographic variables from 2009-2016 
US CDC Compressed Mortality Data (https://wonder.cdc.gov/cmf-ICD10.html).

brfss_county_interpolated.csv: the county-level behavioral risk factor variables for 2011 US CDC Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (https://www.cdc.gov/brfss/).

statecode.csv: A map between state name and state abbreviations.

<b>Additional Data Source: </b><br>
The county-level PM2.5 exposure data can be created via PM2.5 predictions from The Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group at Dalhouse University (http://fizz.phys.dal.ca/~atmos/martin/). Please visit the detailed instructions below

- Download PM25 predictions: https://github.com/wxwx1993/PM_COVID/blob/master/additional_preprocessing_code/download_pm25_values.md. This code makes use of ZIP code shape files provided by ESRI.
- County-level aggregation: https://github.com/wxwx1993/PM_COVID/blob/master/additional_preprocessing_code/rm_pm25_to_county.md

We thank Randall Martin and the members of the Atmospheric Composition Analysis Group at Dalhouse University for providing access to their open-source datasets. Their data (V4.NA.02.MAPLE) that we used can be found here: https://sites.wustl.edu/acag/datasets/surface-pm2-5/. Citation: van Donkelaar, A., R. V. Martin, C. Li, R. T.

Technol., doi: 10.1021/acs.est.8b06392, 2019. 

The seasonal temperature and relative humidity data can be created via 4km × 4km temperature and relative humidity predictions from Gridmet via google earth engine (https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/IDAHO_EPSCOR_GRIDMET).

We thank John Abatzoglou and members of the Climatology Lab at University of Idaho for providing the GRIDMET open-source datasets.
